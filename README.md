# Graveyard Shift

Welcome to the start of your graveyard shift. You are a grounds keeper at a cemetery on Halloween night. This graveyard has a secret though. It comes to life on Halloween night. Will you survive to see the morning?

This was a mini project completed in only 3 weeks (after my day job). Halloween is one of my favorite holidays, and I wanted to create my first spooky game. I hope you enjoy!!
